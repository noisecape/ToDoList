# ToDoList

This very basic project is a "To Do List" application, where you can create a task, and insert it into the "system". Since it is a very basic application, it doesn't save the information permanently, means that when you close the app, all the tasks inserted are eliminated. This project was just a test for javafx, in Java 11 SE. 

What I've learned:\n
  -1 How to setup a javafx project\n
  -2 Basic GUI elements from javafx library such as Labels, Buttons, ListView\n
  -3 Basic handling events in java\n
  -4 How to use the Scene Builder\n
